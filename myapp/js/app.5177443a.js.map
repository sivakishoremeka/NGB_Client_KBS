Despite these efforts, You should know that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with information. You are also responsible for helping to protect the security of Your information and having a strong password that You’ve not used in other places is important. You hereby consent to provide accurate personal information and undertake not to share/provide/divulge information relating to Your password(s) and account registration to any third-party at any point of time. You hereby consent that all Your data shall be stored on a third party server and archived for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days from the date of deletion of the App from Your device.

However, we may reject a request for a number of reasons, including, for example, that the request risks the privacy of other users, requires technical efforts that are disproportionate to the request, is repetitive, or is unlawful. If You need to access, update, or delete other personal information that we may have, You can put in a request at briplkolhapur@bhimariddhi.in. Since Your privacy is important to us, we may ask You to verify Your identity or provide additional information before we let You access or update Your personal information. We will try to update and access Your information for free, but if it would require a disproportionate effort on our part, we may charge a fee. We will of course disclose the fee before we comply with Your request.\n          <br />1.
